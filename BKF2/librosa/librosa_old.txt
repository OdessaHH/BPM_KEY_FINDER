    The estimate_bpm() function takes an audio_file parameter, representing the path to an audio file.

    Inside the function, the librosa.load() function is used to load the audio file. The sr=None argument ensures that the original sample rate of the audio file is preserved, and the function returns two values: audio_data and sample_rate.

    The librosa.beat.beat_track() function is then called to estimate the BPM (tempo) of the loaded audio. It takes two keyword arguments: y (audio data) and sr (sample rate). The function returns two values: tempo (estimated BPM) and beat_frames (frame indices of detected beats).

    The round() function is used to round the tempo value to the nearest whole number, representing the estimated BPM.

    The rounded BPM value is stored in the estimated_bpm variable.

    The estimated_bpm value is returned from the estimate_bpm() function.

    The audio_file variable is set to the path of the audio file you want to analyze.

    Finally, the estimate_bpm() function is called with audio_file as an argument, and the result is printed using the print() function.

When you run the code, it loads the audio file, estimates the BPM using Librosa's beat tracking algorithm, rounds the BPM value, and prints the estimated BPM.

Make sure to replace '/home/user/Music/keybpm.wav' with the actual path to your audio file before running the code.
