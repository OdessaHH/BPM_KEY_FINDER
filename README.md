# BPM_KEY_FINDER
Simple tool for estimating BPM and KEY of electronic music with GUI
This Python project is designed to analyze electronic music tracks in MP3 or WAV format. It determines the BPM (beats per minute) and identifies the key of the track. The project utilizes the Essentia library for BPM analysis and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## Features

- Analyze electronic music tracks in MP3 or WAV format
- Calculate the BPM (beats per minute) of the track using Essentia
- Determine the key of the track
- Simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Essentia library (`pip install essentia`)
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the latest stable version file.
2. The GUI window will appear.
3. Click on the "Open File" button to browse and select the electronic music track you want to analyze.
4. After selecting the file, the program will process it and display the calculated BPM and key information on the GUI.

## File Format Support

The program supports the following file formats for music tracks:

- MP3 (.mp3)
- WAV (.wav)

## Future Enhancements

This project can be further improved with the following enhancements:

- Support for additional file formats
- Integration of more accurate BPM analysis algorithms
- Implementation of advanced key detection algorithms
- Enhanced GUI features and design
